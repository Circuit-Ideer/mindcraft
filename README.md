## BCI Devices

This presentation makes use of two BCI devices. The first a NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile 2 which is a single channel headset which is good for building BCI applications that can function off alpha and beta-rhythms. The second headset is a Ultracortex Mark IV by OpenBCI which can support up to 16 channels which allows for more complicated BCI experiments such as ones leveraging the visual cortex and the motor cortex.

### OpenBCI

Mindcraft leverages a 16 electrode OpenBCI EEG Headset setup with the daisy module. The following is a diagram using the 10-20 system to describe where to place electrodes on your headset.
